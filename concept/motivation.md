# Motivation

A car's history largely determines its value. Whether it was always maintained properly, what it's mileage is and if it had any accidents.
Traditionally this history is only kept on paper documents, wasn't even documented or only kept by a closed set of authorities.
 
By creating a digital, unforgeable, decentralized, public record for a car this problem can be mitigated.  

If you look at the requirements for such a system (distributed, public, secure, unforgeable) the blockchain technology can be a good fit for this use case. **Not as a crypto currency but as a distributed database.**

## Advantages

### For a car seller/owner

- By having a verified history the value of the car is increased because it's history is verifiable.
- Having a transparent market overview of the state of similar cars helps to evaluate the car. 

### For a car buyer

- The buyer can be sure about the state and history of the car he buys.
- Having a transparent market overview of the state of similar cars helps to evaluate the car.

### For a car workshop/dealer

- Transparency about the history of cars
- Possibility for better service (e.g. if accidents are known the workshop can perform additional checks on those parts)
- Same advantages as a buyer/seller if acting in that role

### For Scout24

- Transparent market overview can be used to optimize other products.
- Known car owners can be reminded about upcoming necessary service checks. Potential for new products and to keep the user on the platform during the car ownership lifecycle.
- Potential to monetize certain request for detailed metadata about a car.

### For other partners of the system (e.g. ADAC, TÃœV, mobile.de)

- Increase market transparency
- Protect consumers (against fraud as well as "unsafe" cars)
- Same advantages as for Scout24
